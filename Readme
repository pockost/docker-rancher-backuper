This container contain some tools to make a lot of backup task. This project work, but not only, with Rancher.

To add more backup task you have to customize you crontab rules with the /etc/crontabs/root

Add a crontab rules like

```
0			2			*		*			*				ash /usr/local/bin/backup_mysql.sh
0			4			*		*			*				ash /usr/local/bin/backup_to_ftp.sh /tmp/backup/mysql ftp.example.com ftp_username ftp_password ftp/destination/path
```

And run the container

```
docker run -v path/to/crontab_file:/etc/crontabs/root -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /data/backup:/tmp/backup pockost/rancher-backuper
```

At 2 o'clock, this will launch mysqldump task on all container named with "mysql", "mariadb" or "db" in the name and if the mysqldump command exist in.
All backup will be stored in /data/backup/mysql on the host (/tmp/backup/mysql into container) and be compress with gzip.
At 4 o'clock a full copy will be send to FTP server using duplicity tools.


Note: The /var/run/docker.sock is needed since this one is used to detect and connect to mysql containers.


Backup a directory to FTP
=========================

Mount folder to backup into container. For the instance

```docker run -v /path/to/backup:/data -v /data/backup:/tmp/backup pockost/rancher-backuper```

Add a contab line like this one

```
0			4			*		*			*				ash /usr/local/bin/backup_to_ftp.sh /data ftp.example.com ftp_username ftp_password ftp/destination/path
```

Note: The ftp destination path should exist on FTP server.


Temp dir organization
=====================

```
/tmp/backup
           /mysql  => Mysql Backup
           /tmp    => Duplicity tmp folder
```

Note
====

If you have to following error :

```
Giving up after 5 attempts. BackendException: Error running 'lftp -c "source /tmp/backup/tmp/duplicity-3_oi4L-tempdir/mkstemp-IZQQw6-1; ( cd mysql/ && ls ) || ( mkdir -p mysql/ && cd mysql/ && ls )"': returned 1, with output:

cd: Login failed: 530 Bad credentials
mkdir: Login failed: 530 Bad credentials
```

You have to create destination folder on FTP. For the instance here the mysql folder
